## *Small but Powerful and Efficient*

TreeFrog Framework is a high-speed and full-stack C++ framework for developing Web applications, which supports HTTP and WebSocket protocol.
 
Because the sever-side framework was written in C++/Qt, web applications can run faster than that of scripting language. In application development, it provides an O/R mapping system and template systems on an MVC architecture, aims to achieve high productivity through the policy of  convention over configuration.
